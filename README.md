# HydroFarms GmbH

HydroFarms GmbH is a new vertical farm in the Cologne area, producing herbs and leafy vegetables all year round. Our plants grow in a hydroponic shelf system, where the roots hang in a nutrient solution instead of in the soil and can thus be perfectly cared for.

## Our Mission

With a team of 6 people, our start-up wants to achieve great things. In Wessling, we will soon be able to produce up to 7 tons of herbs and salads per month. A number that would require a lot of space in conventional cultivation – we only need a hall with 200m², save an extremely large amount of water and can guarantee consistent quality regionally all year round.

In the face of increasing water scarcity - worldwide and especially in Germany - we see the need to create alternatives to conventional agriculture and to modernize food production in an efficient way. With the learnings of the last few years and after many analyses and tests on our prototypes, we manage to avoid the biggest pain points in the industry. For example, we are taking a low-cost approach and, for the time being, deliberately refraining from using technologies that could automate processes but consume an enormous amount of energy. Thanks to our specially developed indoor hydroponic racks, we can guarantee regional, efficient and cost-effective production of leafy greens all year round – regardless of the weather and without pesticides.

We want to take a step into the future of food production and are looking forward to soon being able to deliver the freshest salads and herbs to the local organic markets, catering companies, restaurants and supermarkets in Cologne all year round.

## Our Products

Our production is flexibly adaptable and thus makes it possible, for example, to supply the catering industry with special products on request. Our product range currently primarily includes mint and dill, but we have also been successful with pak choi, chard, basil and various salads, among others. At the same time, we are always trying out new plants in our laboratory system - feel free to come to us with ideas!
